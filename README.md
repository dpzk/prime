# prime
Prime finder c++ program (Not effective)

Description
To determine if n is a prime:
1.cpp using the method: try deviding all number from 2 to n.
2.cpp using 1.cpp's methold, but trying from different number for different size of n.
3.cpp using AKS PRIME (not finished too difficult)

You may find some program is in debug mode (starting without asking the range). Just tell me.
